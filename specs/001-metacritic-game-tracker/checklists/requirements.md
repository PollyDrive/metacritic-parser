## Notes

- All 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (FR-005, FR-016, FR-021) resolved 2026-09-08: top-up from See All same run; similar games = Metacritic's own "Related Games" list intersected with catalog; monitoring/force-run gated behind single-operator login+password.
- Spec is clean; ready for `/speckit-plan` (or `/speckit-clarify` if further de-risking desired).
